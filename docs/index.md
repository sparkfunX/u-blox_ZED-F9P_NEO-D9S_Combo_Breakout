# SparkX u-blox ZED-F9P NEO-D9S Combo Breakout

The [SparkX u-blox ZED-F9P NEO-D9S Combo Breakout (SPX-20167)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/20167) combines the u-blox ZED-F9P multi-band high precision GNSS module
with the NEO-D9S L-band GNSS correction data receiver. With a clear view of the sky, especially a clear view to the South, this combo breakout will deliver centimeter-level
accuracy positioning without needing separate RTK or NTRIP corrections. An on-board splitter (power divider) allows you to connect both modules to a single L1/L2/L-Band antenna.

The Combo Breakout is designed to work with u-blox's PointPerfect L-band satellite GNSS augmentation service, which provides homogeneous coverage in contiguous USA and Europe.
