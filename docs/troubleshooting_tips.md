### PointPerfect Satellite Broadcast

PointPerfect augmentation data is broadcast from satellites covering Europe and contiguous USA. The satellites are in geostationary orbits over the equator - the same as for satellite television broadcasts. It is essential that your antenna has an unobstructed view of the sky, especially to the South where the satellite is positioned.

Depending on your latitude, the satellite for your area could be low in the sky. You need to ensure that trees, buildings etc. are not blocking the signal.
